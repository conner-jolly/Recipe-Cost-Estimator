# Where The Wild Things Glow 
Inspiration for this project was from the 2019 KIBA winning Infographic by Jonni Walker. I really appreciated his take on bioluminescence in Australia but wanted to expand it to other areas of the world and make a tool to help find them in your area.  the sql is an example of how this pulled data could be used to take away insights and how I was able to pull it all together.
